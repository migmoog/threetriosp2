Our experience with our provider group was minimal. They wrote well documented code that was understandable
and easy to work with.

Frankly, what we've learned is that we're happy with our design. 2D arrays are good until you have more
complex rules for your grid like multiple states of being. We've saved a lot of space both memory and implementation-wise
by not having to write double for loops to search through our grid.

We also like our structure involving the volatility of our data. The only thing mutatable is the model and
its respective player objects, nothing involving the cards can affect how the game is played.
